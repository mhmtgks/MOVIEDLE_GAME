# The Movidle Game

The Movidle is a movie guessing game. Players have five chances to guess a movie name, with 
feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles that reveal specific information about 
the movie, such as year, genre, origin, director, and star. After every guess, each tile is marked 
as either green or red: green indicates that the information is correct, while red indicates it is 
wrong. 
Figure 1 shows screenshots of a Movidle game in which the player attempts to guess the correct 
movie title, which is "The Dark Knight." Initially, the player guesses "Memento," resulting in 
tiles for origin and director being colored green since they match "The Dark Knight." The 
player's second guess is "The Prestige," which also results in the genre, origin, director, and star 
being matched, indicated by green tiles. Finally, the player guesses "The Dark Knight," 
resulting in all tiles being green and a "You Win" pop-up message. To start a new game, the 
player can simply click the "Restart" button.
